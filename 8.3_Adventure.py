ADVENTURE PROGRAM
-----------------
1.) Use the pseudo-code on the website to help you set up the basic move through the house program
2.) Print off a physical map for players to use with your program
3.) Expand your program to make it a real adventure game


IDEAS:
 -TIME TRAVEL, Same levels across 3 differnt stages in time "Past/Present/Future"
 -PERSPECTIVE WARP, A item that lets you change your perspective (ex: Pickup specal item to allow you to change the size of a door)

room = ["You are in the Court Yard. Its a rectangular grassy area with a large tree in the center. On all sides the Courtyard is surrounded by blackballs with decoration that reminds you of the 1920s. On one wall there are 3 doors, The door furthest to the left is ridiculously large. The door handle is at least 15 feet off the ground. The door in the middle is normal sized. The door furthest to the right is very small, perhaps large enought for you to put your hand in. "]
